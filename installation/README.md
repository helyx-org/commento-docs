### Installation

As previously mentioned, there are two versions of Commento &ndash; the cloud service and the self-hosted software. To install Commento, choose the version that's appropriate for you and proceed from there:

 - [**Cloud Service**](cloud-service/README.md) &ndash; if you're a [Commento.io](commento.io) customer

 - [**Self-hosting**](self-hosting/README.md) &ndash; if you're installing Commento on your server
