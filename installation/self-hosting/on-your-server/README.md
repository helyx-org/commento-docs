### Install Commento on Your Server

This is the first step of the process. In this step, you will install a Commento instance on your server that can serve requests in the future.

#### Available Methods

There are three ways to install Commento on your server:

 - [Release binaries](release-binaries.md): With this method, you can run the official Commento release binaries directly. It is recommended to use your distribution's official packaging, if available.

 - [Using Docker](docker.md): Docker, often combined with Docker Compose, is a powerful tool to manage production services effortlessly. Installation, upgradation, and removal is made simple with Docker.

 - [Compiling from source](compiling-source.md): As always, you can compile a production build of Commento. This option gives you the most flexibility and control. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility; things may break. This is the only method that requires build dependencies.
