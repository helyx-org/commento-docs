### Configuration

Commento is quite configurable. You're free to inject custom styling CSS, JavaScript, display comment counts, and so on. The frontend documentation here will assumes you're using the [cloud service](https://commento.io). However, most instructions should be virtually identical for the self-hosted version:

 - [**Frontend**](frontend/README.md): custom CSS styling to change appearance, display comment count links, configure when Commento is loaded, and more.

If you're self-hosting Commento, you can also configure the backend:

 - [**Backend**](backend/README.md): server binding address, setting up PostgreSQL, configuring SMTP, enabling OAuth, configuring a CDN, compression of static assets, and more. (Applicable only if you're self-hosting Commento.)
